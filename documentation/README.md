# Gender Gap in the Energy Sector

## Context:

The impacts of climate change aren't gender-neutral; women often bear the brunt of climate-related disasters and face more significant obstacles in participating in climate response strategies. Given that sectors like energy are vital in shaping climate policies, the gender disparity within these sectors can significantly influence the effectiveness of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. Women's valuable insights and expertise still need to be utilized, particularly in top-level management and decision-making roles.

## Problem Statement

This project scrutinizes the gender disparity in top-level leadership roles within Canadian corporations across multiple sectors, particularly emphasizing the energy industry. Leveraging gender-disaggregated data, we aim to reveal the potential influence of gender balance in decision-making roles on more effective and inclusive climate policies.

### Simplified Objectives:
Quantify Gender Disparity: Measure the percentage of women in top officer and board director positions in Canadian corporations' energy sector.

Industry Comparison: Briefly compare these findings with other sectors like construction, finance, and management to identify trends or disparities.

Data Visualizations: Generate straightforward, interactive visualizations that summarize gender representation in leadership roles within the energy sector.

Short-Term Predictive Analysis: Conduct a basic predictive analytics model to forecast short-term trends in gender representation within the energy sector.

### Deliverables
Cleaned Dataset: A ready-to-analyze, gender-disaggregated dataset focused on the energy sector and other key industries.

Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations: Summary statistics and basic interactive visualizations.

Predictive Model: A simple predictive analytics model forecasting short-term trends in gender representation within the energy sector.

Summary Report: A concise report outlining key findings and offering preliminary recommendations for improving gender balance in decision-making roles across sectors.



## Detailed Methods for the objectives:

1. Data Collection & Preparation (P0)
Extract relevant data attributes focusing on leadership roles.
Handle missing, inconsistent, or outlier data points to ensure data quality.
Conduct initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distributions and relationships between variables.

2. Descriptive Analysis and Visualization
a. Descriptive Statistical Analysis (P0)
Calculate the percentage representation of women in leadership roles across energy and non energy sectors.
Analyze the variance and disparity within and across industries, company sizes, and provinces.
b. Interactive Data Visualization (P0)
Develop intuitive and user-friendly dashboards using visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI.
Showcase the representation of women in leadership roles with options to filter by position, company size, and province.

3. Comparative Analysis (P0)
a. Sector-Wise Comparison
Compare gender representation in the energy sector with other identified sectors.
Identify trends, disparities, or anomalies specific to the energy sector.
b. Insight Generation
Draw insights from the comparative analysis to understand the relative positioning of the energy sector in gender representation.



4. Report Generation (P0)
a. Summary Report Preparation
Compile key findings, insights, and visualizations into a concise and comprehensive report.
Offer preliminary recommendations based on the data insights for improving gender representation.
b. Review and Refinement
Review the report for accuracy, clarity, and coherence.
Refine the content to ensure it is compelling and actionable for stakeholders.

5. Final Presentation Preparation (P0)
a. Presentation Development
Develop a clear and engaging presentation that highlights the essential findings and recommendations.
Incorporate visual aids and interactive elements to enhance audience engagement.


## Non-Goals (Scope Limitations):
Long-Term Forecasting: Due to the 40-hour constraint, this project will not aim to provide long-term forecasts of gender representation in the energy sector or other industries.

Policy Recommendations: Although the focus is on gender disparity and its potential influence on climate policies, we won't be able to delve into specific policy recommendations given the time frame.

Primary Data Collection: The project will rely on existing gender-disaggregated data and will not engage in the collection of primary data.

Intersectional Analysis: While gender-disaggregated data is vital, this project will not explore other intersectional factors such as race, age, or socio-economic status due to time/data limitations.

Implementation Plans: Given the scope, the project will focus on analysis and short-term predictive models rather than crafting detailed implementation plans for achieving gender parity.

Comprehensive Industry Analysis: Due to time constraints, the project will not conduct an exhaustive comparison across all industry sectors but will selectively focus on a few, emphasizing the energy sector.




## Definition / Data Dictionary 


Statistics Canadaâ€™s Representation of women and men on boards of directors and in officer positions, by firm attributes data highlight women in leadership and strategic decision-making roles and women that lead the day-to-day operations within corporations conducting business in Canada. It allows the user to compare and analyze data based on industry, size (assets), province, country of control and type of corporation.

Definitions
Directors: Generally, directors are responsible for supervising the activities of corporations and making decisions on those activities. Shareholders also elect them.

Executive: An executive is a person who occupies a leadership and decision-making role within an enterprise, and who contributes either as a board director or as an officer.

All officers: Officers lead the day-to-day operations of a corporation and are appointed by board directors.

Top officers: The top officer category consists of individuals who occupy one of the following positions: chairperson, president, vice president and executive vice president.

Other officers: The other officer category consists of individuals who occupy one of the following positions: secretary, assistant secretary, treasurer, assistant treasurer, secretary treasurer, controller, auditor, and others.

Size (assets): Company size was determined by assets, then classified by quartiles. More specifically, smaller firms were classified in the first quartile, small-to-medium companies were classified in the second quartile, medium-to-large firms were classified in the third quartile and larger firms were classified in the fourth quartile.
